# About  

This online course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching,  divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large  problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice  solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).
