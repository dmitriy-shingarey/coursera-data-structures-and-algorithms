# Programming Assignment: Sum of Two Digits  

In this very first programming challenge, your goal is to implement a program that reads two digits from the standard input and prints their sum to the standard  output.  We start from this ridiculously simple problem to show you the pipeline of reading the problem statement, designing an algorithm, implementing it,  testing and debugging your program, and submitting it to the grading system.
